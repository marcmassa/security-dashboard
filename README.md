### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd security-dashboard

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/securitydb"
export SESSION_SECRET="your-secure-secret-key"

# Initialize database
python -c "from app import app, db; app.app_context().push(); db.create_all()"

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### First Time Setup
1. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`
2. Navigate to Configuration (Admin access required)
3. Configure SonarQube integration if available
4. Create your first project
5. Upload security reports to start analysis

## üìä Security Risk Heatmap

The interactive security heatmap provides comprehensive threat visualization:

### View Modes
- **Grid View**: Matrix display of risk scores across projects and categories
- **Tree Map**: Hierarchical visualization showing risk distribution
- **Bubble Chart**: Interactive bubbles sized by risk severity

### Risk Categories
- **Vulnerabilities**: CVE analysis from Trivy and SBOM data
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube metrics including bugs and code smells
- **Dependencies**: Outdated packages and vulnerable dependencies
- **Containers**: Container-specific security issues and misconfigurations

### Real-time Features
- Automatic data refresh (configurable intervals)
- Live threat monitoring and notifications
- Timeline visualization showing 24-hour risk trends
- Interactive drill-down for detailed risk analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### SonarQube Integration
1. Navigate to **Configuration ‚Üí SonarQube Integration**
2. Enter your SonarQube server URL and authentication token
3. Test connection and save configuration
4. Projects can now fetch data directly from SonarQube

### Project Management
1. Create projects through the **New Project** button
2. Upload reports individually or via CI/CD integration
3. View real-time analysis as reports are processed
4. Access the Security Heatmap for cross-project risk visualization

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### Jenkins Pipeline Integration
```bash
python scripts/jenkins-integration.py \
  --dashboard-url "https://security-dashboard.company.com" \
  --project "MyProject" \
  --sonarqube-report "reports/sonar-report.json" \
  --sbom-report "reports/sbom.json" \
  --trivy-report "reports/trivy-report.json" \
  --jenkins-build "${BUILD_NUMBER}" \
  --jenkins-url "${BUILD_URL}"
```

### Webhook Notifications
Configure external systems to receive security updates:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://security-dashboard.company.com/api/projects/{id}/webhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "scan_complete", "severity": "high", "details": "..."}'
```
